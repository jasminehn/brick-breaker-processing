# Brick Breaker Processing
 
As a final project for my first programming class in college, Software Development (CS128-52), we were tasked with creating a project in Processing.

The player can play with either the keyboard or the mouse to maneuver the paddle. There is also a hidden "secret mode" that does something special. See if you can find it!

### Difficulty

The player can select the difficulty between easy, normal, hard, and extreme. The harder the difficulty, the smaller the paddle is.

### Gameplay

The score is increased by 5 each time a block is destroyed and increased by 1 each time the ball touches the paddle.

The player moves to the next level when all the bricks are cleared.

The ball gets faster with each level.

There is an infinite number of levels.
